Problem: classify 3 Iris species

Classification techniques: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, kNN, SVM, Decision Tree, Boosted Tree, Random Forest, MLP

2. [**Loan Prediction**](./LoanPrediction)

[Dataset](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-loan-prediction-iii/): custumers' details such as Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others.

Problem: predict loan eligibility (Y/N)

Classification techniques: Linear SVC, SVC, kNN, Random Forest

## Regression

3. [**Bigmart Sales**](./BigmartSales)

[Dataset](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-big-mart-sales-iii/): 2013 sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities with certain attributes of each product and store such as weight, maximum retail price, size of store and so on.

Problem: predict sales

Regression techniques: Linear Regression, Neural Network

4. [**Boston House Price**](./BostonHousePrice)

[Dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~delve/data/boston/bostonDetail.html): 506 cases with 14 attributes for each.

Problem: predict NOX (nitrous oxide level) and MEDV (median value of a home price)

Regression techniques: Linear Regression, ElasticNetCV, LassoCV
