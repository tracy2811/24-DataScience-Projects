Libraries: [scikit learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/), [keras](https://keras.io/)

2. [R](https://www.r-project.org/)

## Classification

1. [Iris Species](./Iris)

[Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/iris): 3 Iris species with 50 samples each and 4 properties, i.e., Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Lenth, Petal Width (in cm).

Problem: classify 3 Iris species

Classification techniques: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, kNN, SVM, Decision Tree, Boosted Tree, Random Forest, MLP

2. [Loan Prediction](./LoanPrediction)

[Dataset](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-loan-prediction-iii/): custumers' details such as Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others.
